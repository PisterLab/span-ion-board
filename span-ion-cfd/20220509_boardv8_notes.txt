don't have to go through 4pcb, maybe do 4 layers?
routing, ground, ground, routing
take a look at controlled impedance stackup
same trace width
maybe? probably not, mmcx, snap-in, no cables readily available
leave more space
output coax, series terminate on output, maybe 30ohm or something on the output
Consider high speed probe tip, sticking a ground someplace where it's close to the chip
